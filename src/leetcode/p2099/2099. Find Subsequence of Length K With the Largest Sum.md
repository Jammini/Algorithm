### 2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum

---

#### 문제설명

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You want to find a subsequence of nums of length k that has the
largest sum.

Return any such subsequence as an integer array of length k.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the
order of the remaining elements.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
Output: [3,3]
Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
Output: [-1,3,4]
Explanation: 
The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
Output: [3,4]
Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7. 
Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
- 1 <= k <= nums.length

#### 문제풀이

```java

class Number implements Comparable<Number> {
    int index;
    int num;

    public Number(int index, int num) {
        this.index = index;
        this.num = num;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Number o) {
        return o.num - this.num;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int[] maxSubsequence(int[] nums, int k) {
        int[] answer = new int[k];
        List<Number> list = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            list.add(new Number(i, nums[i]));
        }

        Collections.sort(list);

        int[] index = new int[k];

        for (int i = 0; i < index.length; i++) {
            index[i] = list.get(i).index;
        }
        Arrays.sort(index);
        for (int i = 0; i < answer.length; i++) {
            answer[i] = nums[index[i]];
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
