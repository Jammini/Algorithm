### 3619. Count Islands With Total Value Divisible by K

---

#### 문제설명

You are given an m x n matrix grid and a positive integer k. An island is a group of positive integers (representing land) that are 4-directionally connected (horizontally or vertically).

The total value of an island is the sum of the values of all cells in the island.

Return the number of islands with a total value divisible by k.

##### Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/06/example1griddrawio-1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,2,1,0,0],[0,5,0,0,5],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,4,7,0],[0,2,0,0,8]], k = 5

Output: 2

Explanation:

The grid contains four islands. The islands highlighted in blue have a total value that is divisible by 5, while the islands highlighted in red do not.
```

##### Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/03/06/example2griddrawio.png)
```
Input: grid = [[3,0,3,0], [0,3,0,3], [3,0,3,0]], k = 3

Output: 6

Explanation:

The grid contains six islands, each with a total value that is divisible by 3.

        int answer = 0;
        visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];

        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {

                    visited[i][j] = true;
                    int sum = dfs(grid, i, j);
                    if(sum % k == 0) {
                        answer++;

                }
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }

    public int dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        int sum = grid[i][j];

        for(int a = 0; a < 4; a++) {
            int x = i + dx[a];
            int y = j + dy[a];

            if(x >= 0 && x < grid.length && y >= 0 && y < grid[0].length && grid[x][y] > 0 && !visited[x][y]) {
                visited[x][y] = true;
