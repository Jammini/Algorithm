### 1631. Path With Minimum Effort

---

#### 문제설명

You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

##### Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex1.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
```

##### Example 2:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex2.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
```

##### Example 3:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
```

**Constraints:**

- rows == heights.length
- columns == heights[i].length
- 1 <= rows, columns <= 100
- 1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumEffortPath(int[][] heights) {
        int rows = heights.length;
        int cols = heights[0].length;
        int[][] minEffort = new int[rows][cols];
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(minEffort[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }

        minEffort[0][0] = 0;
        int[][] dir = new int[][]{{-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}};
        Deque<int[]> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
        dq.addLast(new int[]{0, 0});

        while (!dq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] node = dq.pollFirst();
            int x = node[0];
            int y = node[1];
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int dx = x + dir[i][0];
                int dy = y + dir[i][1];
                if (dx >= 0 && dx < minEffort.length && dy >= 0 && dy < minEffort[0].length) {
                    if (minEffort[dx][dy] > Math.max(minEffort[x][y], Math.abs(heights[x][y] - heights[dx][dy]))) {
                        minEffort[dx][dy] = Math.max(minEffort[x][y], Math.abs(heights[x][y] - heights[dx][dy]));
                        dq.addLast(new int[]{dx, dy});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return minEffort[minEffort.length - 1][minEffort[0].length - 1];
    }
}
```
