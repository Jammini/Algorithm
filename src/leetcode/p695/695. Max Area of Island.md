### 695. Max Area of Island

---

#### 문제설명

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

##### Example 1:

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

##### Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

```java
class Solution {
    int[] dx = {0, 1, 0, -1};
    int[] dy = {-1, 0, 1, 0};

    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int maxIsland = 0;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];

        for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if(grid[i][j] == 1 && !visited[i][j]) { // 섬이면서 방문하지 않았을 경우
                    int islandSize = dfs(grid, i, j, visited, 1);
                    maxIsland = Math.max(maxIsland, islandSize);
                }
            }
        }
        return maxIsland;
    }

    public int dfs(int[][] grid, int x, int y, boolean[][] visited, int size) {
        visited[x][y] = true;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nx = dx[i] + x;
            int ny = dy[i] + y;

            if(nx < 0 || nx >= grid.length || ny < 0 || ny >= grid[0].length || grid[nx][ny] == 0 || visited[nx][ny]) {
                continue;
            }
            size = dfs(grid, nx, ny, visited, size + 1);
        }
        return size;
    }
}
