### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

---

#### 문제설명

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

##### Example 4:

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

##### 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int answer = 1;
        HashSet set = new HashSet();

        if ("".equals(s)) {
            return 0;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(i))) {
                set.add(s.charAt(i));
                count++;
            } else {
                if (answer < count){
                    answer = count;
                }
                i = i - count;
                count = 0;
                set.clear();
            }
        }
        if (answer < count){
            answer = count;
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
