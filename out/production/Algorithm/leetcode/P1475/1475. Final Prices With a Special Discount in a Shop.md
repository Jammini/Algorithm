### 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

---

#### 문제설명

Given the array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the `ith` item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the `ith` item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to `prices[j]` where `j` is the **minimum** index such that `j > i` and `prices[j] <= prices[i]`, otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

*Return an array where the `ith` element is the final price you will pay for the `ith` item of the shop considering the special discount.*

##### Example 1:

```
Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 500`
- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^3`



#### 문제풀이

처음 result배열에 prices배열을 복사한다. prices 배열에 들어오는 index를 0부터 기준을 하나씩 증가하며 기준보다 작은 할인폭을 만나면 그 할인폭을 빼서 결과 값 배열에 계산하여 넣어준다. 

즉 변경된 값만 바꿔서 result배열 값을 변경해서 return한다.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] finalPrices(int[] prices) {
        int[] result = new int[prices.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            result[i] = prices[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                if (prices[i] >= prices[j]) {
                    result[i] = prices[i] - prices[j];
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
